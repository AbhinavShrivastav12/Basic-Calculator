hello in this code it's a basic calculator that operates using the arithmetic operators and follows the BODMAS rule.
If you enter the input like (8/0) it gives the output "Error" because it's not possible that anything can be divided by zero. 
It clears down the output after the Error or undefined case automatically after 2 Seconds.
